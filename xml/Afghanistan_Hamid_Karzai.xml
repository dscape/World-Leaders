        Hamid Karzai, GCMG is the 12th and current President of Afghanistan, taking office on 7 December 2004. He became a dominant political figure after the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001. During the International Conference on Afghanistan in Bonn, Germany, on 5 December 2001, Karzai was selected by prominent Afghan political figures to serve a six month term as Chairman of the Transitional Administration.
        He was then chosen for a two years term as the Interim President during the 2002 Loya Jirga in Kabul, Afghanistan. After the 2004 presidential election, Karzai won and became President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. He again won the 2009 presidential election after his opponent withdrew from the run-off race.
