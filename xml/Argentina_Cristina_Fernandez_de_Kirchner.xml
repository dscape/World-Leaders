        Cristina Elizabet Fernández de Kirchner, commonly known as Cristina Fernández or Cristina Kirchner, is the current President of Argentina. A member of the Justicialist Party, she was a Senator for Buenos Aires Province before taking office. She is the wife of Néstor Kirchner, current Secretary General of Unasur and former President of Argentina (2003–2007). She acted as First Lady during his term.
        In the October 2007 general election, Fernández ran for the presidency of Argentina, representing the ruling Front for Victory party. She won with 45.3% of the vote, a 22% lead over her nearest rival. This was the widest margin obtained by a candidate since civil rule was reinstalled in 1983, and avoided the need for a runoff election. She is Argentina's first elected female President, and the second female President ever to serve (after Isabel Martínez de Perón, 1974–1976).
