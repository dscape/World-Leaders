        Felipe de Jesús Calderón Hinojosa is the current President of Mexico. He assumed office on December 1, 2006, and was elected for a single six-year term through 2012. He is a member of the National Action Party (PAN), one of the three major Mexican political parties.
        Calderón was elected in the 2006 presidential elections. The results were contested by his closest opponent, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who started what he called a "pacific civil resistance". Calderon's victory was confirmed on September 5, 2006 by the Federal Electoral Tribunal.
        Prior to the presidency, Calderón actively participated in PAN politics. He has served as National President of the Party, Federal Deputy, and Secretary of Energy in Vicente Fox's cabinet.
