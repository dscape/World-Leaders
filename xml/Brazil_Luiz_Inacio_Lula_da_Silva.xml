        Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known popularly as Lula, is the thirty-fifth and current President of Brazil.
        A founding member of the Workers' Party (PT – Partido dos Trabalhadores), he ran for President three times unsuccessfully, first in the 1989 election. Lula achieved victory in 2002, and was inaugurated as President on 1 January 2003. In the 2006 election he was re-elected for a second term as President ending on 1 January 2011.
        His government, as well as his re-election, are one of the most controversial and popular of all politics of Brazil. Social programs like Bolsa Família and Fome Zero are hallmarks of his administration. However, Lula has designed internationally and interfered on important and recent policy decisions such as the Nuclear program of Iran and global warming and has been described as "a man with audacious ambitions to alter the balance of power among nations". He is featured in Time's The 100 Most Influential People in the World for 2010.
