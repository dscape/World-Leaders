# Readme
This work was done during one of the XQuery Basics Classes where customers asked for a demonstration of REST. None of the files was renamed and no code changes were needed to use rewrite.

It does a lazy loading of files, so they will be loaded the first time you call the application.

# Install
Simple create an HTTP App Server pointing to this directory and make rewrite.xqy the rewrite script for that App Server.

# Extra
Added a route to access countries by name, e.g. http://localhost/country/Argentina for demonstration purposes. It's not linked in the application but you can access it directly by URL.
